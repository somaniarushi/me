A list of all my projects, technical or technical-adjacent, of the year of our lord 2021.

**Clippy**:A webpage that implements a clipboard. Made as a fun thought experiment. Try it out at [clippy.amks.me](https://clippy.amks.me) or read about it [here](../blog/clipboard.md).

**Tempest**: Dynamic thought-tree generator, for those trying to bring order to their mental gymnastics. Something I sorely needed. Try it out at [tempest.amks.me](https://tempest.amks.me).

**Helena**: Your CLI personal assistant. Made for all my terminal fanatic friends. Unfortunately not available for use yet, but you can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/somaniarushi/helena).
