## Clippy
A webpage that implements a clipboard. Made as a fun thought experiment. Try it out at [clippy.amks.me](https://clippy.amks.me) or read about it [here](../blog/clipboard.md). Fork it [here](https://github.com/somaniarushi/clippy).

## Tempest
Dynamic thought-tree generator, for those trying to bring order to their mental gymnastics, made in React. Something I sorely needed. Try it out at [tempest.amks.me](https://tempest.amks.me).

## Hullo
A real-time chat app, made using socket.io and Node.js. Play around at [hullo.amks.me](https://hullo.amks.me).
