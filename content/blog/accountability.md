It isn't some unique insight for me to say that being productive has become more and more difficult these quarantine days.

## Who Am I, And Who Do I Want to Be?
Accountability comes not from obligation or deadline, but from a deeply personal question, "am i happy with who i am right now?" and while yes this is absolutely about personality and skills, it's also about what I'm doing day to day - am i happy with how much time i spend talking to others? how much time i spend studying? do i move towards my future goals? do i assess my living in a strict manner to point out flaws where necessary?

on many days, the answer is yes. on a few critical ones, the answer is no, and then its time to reevaluate. 


## Strict Personal Schedules

#### Outline
- the problem with not having schedules, only deadlines
- how you can add schedule to life
- sleep is a fundamental part of this discussion
- go to long-term

- short term (day to day, week to week) but also long term (weekly, monthly, semesterly goals)
- slippery sleep schedule leads to slippery days
- night schedules are horrible, don't do them
- 

## Stats

#### Outline
- the problem with not keeping track
- how to effectively keep track

- being able to keep track of how long you spend doing what is important
- develops accountability (wrote about that here)
- you are biased, data is not
