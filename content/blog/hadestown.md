This weekend, I finally gave in and listening to Hadestown, the Tony-winning Broadway musical retelling of the myth of Eurydice and Orpheus. Jazzy, bright, and fun, the musical is a joy to listen to from start to finish. It's no surprise that it won the Tony for the best musical last year, and I'd recommend everyone to give it a listen.
