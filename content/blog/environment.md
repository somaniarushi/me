My day usually starts with bidding my parents goodnight. I have dinner, attend classes till the sun rises, have some breakfast. Some zoom time with friends in the later hours of the morning, and by noon its time to sleep.

Let me explain. Although I am currently living in India, I'm still enrolled at Berkeley. Because of the 12-hour timezone difference, my schedule is completely flipped. I stay up most nights to attend classes. I wake up around 7PM, and go to sleep around 1PM.

I've also been holed up in one room of the house. A single location for eating, sleeping, relaxing, studying, exercising, and socialising. 

With the world sleeping while I'm awake, it's quite like being the last survival of a zombie apocalyse. This has taken a rather unsurprising hit on my productivity. Spending all this time by myself, I've been able to test and iterate about what works for me and what doesn't.

The biggest variable I've noticed? The environment. 

I now have a much better idea about how to arrange my environment to not only to maximise daily potential but to prevent burnout.

## Don't Rest Where You Work

<!-- #### Outline
- the problem with resting where we're working

- the greater world -->

Spending too much time doing too little is too familiar a state for me these days.

As all the biggest companies of Silicon Valley rush to go remote and a thousand medium articles proclaim the death of the office space, I firmly believe that the office is _not_ dead yet.

Why are libraries effective? It may seem like a random question, but it isn't. Libraries are effective study locations because the silence and atmosphere of the place forces you to focus on your work. Offices are the same way. **Houses are not.**

To work effectively and productively, we need to separate work and play. 

So, three months into quarantine, I started studying and relaxing in different rooms. Much to the chagrin of everyone else living with me, I also completely overhauled the two rooms to _only_ contain objects associated with that room's purpose. No beds in the study room, no books in the resting room.

This kind of system gives you the ability to check out of your work life for a while and take a break.
