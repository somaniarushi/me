_I love music_. And I'm also a music noob. I think it's high time to change that. Starting, of course, with the best music band of all time.

Let's start from the beginning -- their first album, Please Please Me. Here's my unfiltered thoughts, straight from [my twitter](https://twitter.com/amksomani).

## "I'm Just Here For Some Recommendations"
And that's completely cool! Here's my top songs from this album: Love Me Do, Please Please Me, I Saw Her Standing There, Anna, and Twist And Shout. But do stick around for more!

## One Liners About The Songs

- **Love Me Do**:
Can definitely see why this is their leadoff single, it doesn't have the Beatles sound yet, but holy shit is it catchy.

- **PS I Love You**: 
The music structure is so cool, major for the most part, and then bam! dissonant minor chord. gives it a sinister feel, like the guy's definitely gonna die 

- **Please Please Me**:
This song would come off as so needy if it wasn't so polite 

- **Ask Me Why**: 
How can I not like a song that goes "I love youwuwuwuwu"

- **I Saw Her Standing There**:
The lyrics are so problematic but the song os such a bop. This song is exactly what getting a crush feels like.

- **Misery**:
What it feels like to have your crush reject you. I love upbeat sad songs, but it doesn't work as well for me here.The classic 4/4 works against the vibe for me :(

- **Anna (Go To Him)**: 
This goes straight to my sad vibes playlist. I'm a sucker for songs about putting others above your own happiness!

- **Boys**:
Ringo is so good, loving the "drummer's song" vibe of this one. But my favorite way to listen to this song is to sing along with the background singers. bop tu wop bop bop tu wop

- **Baby It's You**:
🎶 shalalalalalalalalalalala 🎶 anyway I also love "you're a horrible person but im in love with you anyway" songs.

- **Do You Want To Know A Secret**:
These Beatles guys have CRAZY good arrangements. Love this song's guitarline, its so catchy.

- **A Taste Of Honey**:
This sounds so different from everything else. So much more jazzy. I think its the first song on the album in 3/3. But it also swaps out for a 4/4 on the chorus?? Very cool

- **There's a Place**:
Surprisingly haven't complimented the harmonica yet. Its lovely, brings the album together

- **Twist and Shout**:
Album closer, and *what a song*. There's some boogaloo music/labamba inspiration, and it plays _so_ well here. John's vocals absolutely KILL. This song's an assault on my senses in the best way. ROCK AND ROLL, WHOOOOOOOOO

... and that's it. A tight 26 minutes.

## And Some Closing Thoughts
Wow. These folks knew how to WRITE. Theres nothing on this album i would dare call boring. Even in simple songs, they sneak in their own flare. insane that they started developing their sound so soon in their career.

HOWEVER. The number of romantic songs on the album directly addressing the listening made me realize. The Beatles were the first Boy Band. I mean, just look at them.

![Phew.](../../images/beatles.jpeg)

One direction is as much a spiritual successor to the Beatles as something like oasis or nirvana. Not saying I like this fact, but I am saying that it is true.

All in all, I dont think I loved this album, but I really enjoyed it and I totally understand beatlemania. Even on songs you personally didn't like you can't help but admire their creativity. I think you could tell even by this album, that there was something unique about these kids.

I, for one, welcome the british invasion. Onto the next one!
