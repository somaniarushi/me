Here's a quick summary of what I did last summer! [Here's what I'm doing right now.](/about/)

## Education
I took [CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory](https://eecs70.org), a class I really enjoyed! I think that taking the class in the summer was challenging and forced me to really consider what I wanted to spend time doing –– making tough decisions about attending discussions, lectures and so on.   

I also took [CS375: Teaching Techniques for Computer Science](https://cs375.github.io), a discussion-based class for first-time teachers. It really forced me to think deeply about the decisions I made as a teacher and how they impacted my students, which I'm very grateful for.

## Teaching
I taught [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://cs61a.org) in the summer! I developed my teaching skills a lot, and I got to take on a lot of responsibility as one of the chief developers of course content. I also developed great connections with a lot of the other brilliant TAs of the class, and feel like I've found my community of teachers!

## Entrepreneurship
I worked on [V A T T](https://vatt.caard.co), an SaaS product with the mission to dub and subtitle the internet. This summer, my team and I participated in [Dorm Room Fund's Female Founder Track](https://femalefounders.dormroomfund.com/), working on rapidly iterate our product, ready for release and fundraising. I got to meet some brilliant women in entrepreneurship, including [Sarah Guo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahxguo/), [Kelly Watkins](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kelly-watkins) and [Jess Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesskah). I was also blessed to have Isabelle, Havi, and Loewen from Dorm Room Fund as my mentors! 

## Internship
I interned this summer as a software development engineer at [Vurbl Media](https://vurbl.com), a startup developing a Youtube-like platform for podcasts. I was part of the team working on developing a transcription section of the audio processing pipeline as well as a search and tagging algorithm. It was extremely interesting to work as a startup in my first internship –– it was extremely different from university!

## BEGIN Volunteer
I was a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for [Berkeley SCET's Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu). I worked with the team as a developer for a new page for the BEGIN website, and will continue working to make BEGIN a portal for entrepreneurship at Berkeley.

## STEP Developer
I'm working as a developer for [Berkeley's Student Entrepreneurship Program](https://step.berkeley.edu). I'll be reforming the website, updating backend and developing software for use of participating teams to track KPIs. I'm excited to help run this idea accelerator this fall!
