Writing this a little later than normal — mainly because of how much of a blur Spring 2021 was. It felt like I did nothing, despite doing a whole lot of things. This was perhaps the toughest COVID semester, and I'm glad that things are returning to normal now. Regardless, he's what I did this spring!

## Education
This spring, I took:
- CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractible Problems
- EECS126: Probability and Random Processes
- 

## Teaching
I'm a big believer in the Feynmann Technique of learning –– that the best teacher is the best learner. I'm a tutor for Data Structures at Berkeley this spring, and am extremely excited to help students through such a critical class!

## BEGIN Developer
I'm working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's [Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu)! It's an exciting prospect to be able to help introduce people to the startup space around Berkeley and create a community of innovators and entrepreneurs!

## Cal Hacks Director
`CODE. BUILD. HACK.` Cal Hacks is the *best* way to get started making side projects that have impact, meaning and innovation. I look forward to helping channel that, through the [Fellowship Program](https://fellowship.calhacks.io) in particular.
