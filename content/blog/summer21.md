A look at my first series of months when I wasn't in some sort of school. It was an exciting time to discover myself, read more, experience more, and travel! This summary doesn't really cover everything I was up to, but it's still pretty interesting, so read on!

## Software Development Intern
I interned at Salesforce, on the Lightning Data Service team, designing a binding between modern Javascript frameworks and Salesforce's internal client-side caching and validation tools. It was an excellent experience, and I had a lot of chances to grow as a developer. It was fun to experience industry for the first time!

## BEGIN Developer
I worked as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's [Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu)! Over the summer, we launched our website, and developed connections with individuals in the Berkeley entrepreneurship ecosystem.

## Floodgate Outliers
I participated the Floodgate Outliers program, geared towards creating a community of ambitious college students and professional development. I felt like I found "my people" in this community, and the organizers of this program are some of the most giving individuals I've had the honor of meeting in VC.
