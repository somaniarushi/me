**Running Total: 1/36**

It's summer! That means it's time to get active, get out there, and explore. This summer, I find myself with some free time and a lot more determination. Because of this, I'm going to start running in the mornings! 

Preferably, I'll be running every morning — but I won't pretend to be able to maintain that perfect a schedule. Instead, here's the goal: go on three runs every week, or 36 runs over the summer.
