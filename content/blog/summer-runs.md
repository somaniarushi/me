**Running Total: 3/36**

It's summer! That means it's time to get active, get out there, and explore. This summer, I find myself with some free time and a lot more determination. Because of this, I'm going to start running in the mornings! 

Preferably, I'll be running every morning — but I won't pretend to be able to maintain that perfect a schedule. Instead, here's the goal: go on three runs every week, or 36 runs over the summer. 

## April 30: Home &#10132; Berkeley Marina
Distance Travelled: 5.4MI (8.7KM)

There's something about a quiet, empty marina that is extremely surreal. I'm sure someone used to walk those beaches and sit on those rocks, but any memory of their existence has been eroded by the winds and the sea. 

I love the ocean. It's powerful as fuck, and feminine as fuck, and both of those things are what make the ocean the ocean.

## May 2: Home &#10132; Strawberry Creek Park
Distance Travelled: 2.6MI (4.18KM)

Usually, I love the parks for the escape they provide from the concrete jungle that is everydaay life in the Silicon Valley. Today, however, sitting on a lone bench, I loved this park simplu for how much life it had. Dogs ran around, parents chased their mischiveous children, couples spread picnic blankets and enjoyed some time together. 

It's been a while since most of us have been able to enjoy life (thanks corona). It was nice to see that again.

## May 3: Home &#10132; Indian Rock Park
Distance Travelled: 4.5MI (7.24KM)

Have you ever stopped to stare at the sky? If you stare hard enough, long enough, you start to feel as if the sky is a ceiling, a circular dome protecting you from the horrors without. I can't explain how, but this is a shared experience I have with anyone I've talked to.

In the vast mysteriousness of nature, we are mere observers, glancing at the sky, *feeling* the roundness, but unable to explain how. Maybe Hawking was onto something when he called the universe a grand design.
