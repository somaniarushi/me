**Running Total: 6/36**

It's summer! That means it's time to get active, get out there, and explore. This summer, I find myself with some free time and a lot more determination. Because of this, I'm going to start running in the mornings! 

Preferably, I'll be running every morning — but I won't pretend to be able to maintain that perfect a schedule. Instead, here's the goal: go on three runs every week, or 36 runs over the summer. 

## April 30: Home &#10132; Berkeley Marina
Distance Travelled: 5.4MI (8.7KM)

I love the ocean. It's powerful as fuck, and feminine as fuck, and both of those things are what make the ocean the ocean.

## May 2: Home &#10132; Strawberry Creek Park
Distance Travelled: 2.6MI (4.18KM)

Parks have so much life. Dogs run around, parents chase their mischiveous children, couples spread picnic blankets and eenjoy some time together. It's been a while since most of us have been able to enjoy life (thanks corona). It was nice to see that again.

## May 3: Home &#10132; Indian Rock Park
Distance Travelled: 4.5MI (7.24KM)

Maybe Hawking was onto something when he called the universe a grand design.

## May 4: Home &#10132; Campbot Park, Upper Rockridge
Distance Travelled: 3.5MI (5.6KM)

It's the worst time to want to be an explorer — too late to explore the Earth, too early to explore the skies. Ah well, guess I'll settle for exploring Californian suburbs.

## May 5: Home &#10132; Boichik Bagels
Distance Travelled: 2.4MI (3.86KM)

Not like the other trips, but I woke up at 6AM for this, so I think it counts. Were the bagels life-changing? I don't know. But they certainly were worth waking up that early.

## May 8: Home &#10132; Aquatic Park
Distance Travelled: 3.12MI (5.02KM)

Running to a park two days before finals? Won't lie— would recommend. Messing up your life is fun!
