Fall 2021. What a semester. One in which it simultaneously felt like I was doing nothing and everything. A lot of what I'd been working on through college came to a crescendo this semester, and I'm very pleased with that.

# TODO

## Education
This fall, I'm learning about Operating Systems and Systems Programming, Optimization Models in Engineering, and Microeconomics. I'm also taking a course in the Ethics and Social Implications of Computer Science!

## Teaching
I'm back to teaching CS61A this semester! Take a peek at my [personal website for the class](https://cs61a.amks.me) for some insight into what goes into running an advanced discussion section. I'm also an instructor for the [Introduction to Full Stack Development Decal](https://fullstackdecal.com) here at Berkeley, a computer science class that teaches students the principles of web development and design.

## BEGIN Developer
I'm working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's [Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu)! It's an exciting prospect to be able to help introduce people to the startup space around Berkeley and create a community of innovators and entrepreneurs!

## Cal Hacks
Code. Build. Hack. This semester, I'm helping bring back the world's biggest collegiate hackathon, [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io), back to Berkeley. If you're reading this, you probably enjoy making things! [You should apply to join Cal Hacks 8.0!](https://apply.calhacks.io).

## Recruiting
Not much to say here, except that I'm recruiting for the summer of 2022. If anything here interests you, [drop me a line](mailto:arushisomani@berkeley.edu).
