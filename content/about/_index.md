title: "About Me, Spring 2022 💪"
---

## Education
This fall, I'm learning about [Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html), [Machine Learning](https://www.eecs189.org/), and [the Foundations of Computer Graphics](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp21). I'm also learning about the fundamentals of [scientific thinking](http://sensesensibilityscience.com/)!

## Research
I'm taking a semester off from my other obligations to invest some time in research! I'm particularly interested in the intersection of Programming Systems and Artificial Intelligence, and how the two interact with one another. I'm researching program synthesis under [Koushik Sen](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/?rnd=1643929000614) this semester, on the [AutoPandas](http://autopandas.io/) project!

## Cal Hacks
`Code. Build. Hack.` This semester, I'm helping [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io) lead the charge with developing and launching new initiatives, and helping out at the [Fellowship](https://fellowship.calhacks.io) program.

## Recruiting
Not much to say here, except that I'm currently actively recruiting, for spring as well as summer. If anything here interests you, [drop me a line](mailto:arushisomani@berkeley.edu) at `hi@amks.me`.

## Hobbies
Recommend me [a book](https://goodreads.com/amks), play squash or basketball with me, or schedule a jam session with me this semester!
