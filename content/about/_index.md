## Software Development Intern
This summer, I'm interning at Salesforce, on the Lightning Data Service team! It's exciting to be able to work on a project with a long legacy, to design and implement ideas that will be used by millions.

## BEGIN Developer
I'm working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's [Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu)! It's an exciting prospect to be able to help introduce people to the startup space around Berkeley and create a community of innovators and entrepreneurs!

## Floodgate Outliers
I'm participating the Floodgate Outliers program, geared towards creating a community of ambitious college students and professional development.
