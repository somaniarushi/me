title: "About Me, Fall 2020 💪"
---

## Education
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. This fall, I'm learning about computer architecture, designing information devices and systems, south asian literature, economics and human biological variation!

## Teaching
I'm a big believer in the Feynmann Technique of learning –– that the best teacher is the best learner. I'm a tutor for CS61A at Berkeley this summer, and am extremely excited to help students through a class I thoroughly enjoyed. [Here's my course website that I set up for my students.](https://cs61a.amks.me)

## BEGIN Developer
I'm working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's [Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu)! It's an exciting prospect to be able to help introduce people to the startup space around Berkeley and create a community of innovators and entrepreneurs!

## STEP Organizer
I'm helping run Berkeley's Student Entrepreneurship Program! It's one of the best ways to partake in entrepreneurship across Berkeley, and I'm excited to help widen the resources and improve participant experience!

## Cal Hacks Director
`CODE. BUILD. HACK.` Cal Hacks is the *best* to get started making side projects that have impact, meaning and innovation. I look forward to helping channel that! Check out Cal Hacks' fall initiative [Hack Month](https://hackmonth.calhacks.io), a month-long endeavor to connect university students to top industry mentors to help them make something awesome!

## Web At Berkeley
The coolest new club on campus! I'm excited to be a part of this young club and help run the education branch. [Check out our website here!](https://webatberkeley.org) #ReactForLife
