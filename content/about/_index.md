## Research
I'm researching at the Berkeley Sky Lab this semester! I'm working in the intersection of Programming Systems and Artificial Intelligence, and how the two interact with one another. Think: Github Copilot, but better. I'm researching program synthesis under [Koushik Sen](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/?rnd=1643929000614) and [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com/) this semester, and starting to spin up my own project!

More particularly, I work in two dimensions of program synthesis:
1. **Gaurantees of Correctness**: How can we generate code that the user can rely on, without having to parse through it themselves?
2. **Better Interfaces for Synthesis**: How can we change the way we ask users to specify what they want, to best capture user intent?

## Learning
This semester, I'm studying about databases, digital circuit design, the history of science, and techniques in program synthesis and testing!

## Hobbies
Recommend me [a book](https://goodreads.com/amks), come bouldering, play squash or basketball with me, or schedule a jam session with me!
