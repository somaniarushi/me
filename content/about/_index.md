title: "About Me, Spring 2021 💪"
---

## Education
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. This spring, I'm learning about computer architecture, designing information devices and systems, south asian literature, economics and human biological variation!

## Teaching
I'm a big believer in the Feynmann Technique of learning –– that the best teacher is the best learner. I'm a tutor for Data Structures at Berkeley this spring, and am extremely excited to help students through such a critical class!

## BEGIN Developer
I'm working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's [Gateway To Innovation Program](https://begin.berkeley.edu)! It's an exciting prospect to be able to help introduce people to the startup space around Berkeley and create a community of innovators and entrepreneurs!

## Cal Hacks Director
`CODE. BUILD. HACK.` Cal Hacks is the *best* way to get started making side projects that have impact, meaning and innovation. I look forward to helping channel that, through the [Fellowship Program](https://fellowship.calhacks.io) in particular.
