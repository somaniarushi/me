title: "About Me 💭"

A random walk through some of the interesting things I've done in the past.
## 👶 Backstory
I grew up in India, in a small town named [Lucknow](https://www.google.com/maps/place/lucknow+india/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x399bfd991f32b16b:0x93ccba8909978be7?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmt7mWuJH-AhXkNEQIHSvqAYwQ8gF6BAgREAE). I was a jack of all trades in high school, organized a lot of events and learned how to be an effective leader. I also got a concurrent bachelor's degree in Indian Classical Music on the violin from [Bhatkhande University](http://bhatkhandemusic.edu.in/). I don't play anymore, but hope to pick it back up eventually.

## 🔬 Research
I researched at the Sky Lab in Berkeley througout college, and found it to be a transformational experience. I researched in the intersection of Programming Systems and Artificial Intelligence. I worked on data visualization tool [Datana](https://github.com/codemonet/databutler) with the incredible [Rohan Bavishi](https://rbavishi.github.io). I also spent some time researching on my own on [RedString](/pdf/redstring) and [Dreamer](/pdf/dreamer). By all definitions, they are failed projects, but I am immensely proud of them.

## 👩‍🏫 Teaching
I taught for five semesters in college, most often the [Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs61a.org) class at Berkeley. I've had >200 students, and all of them are a delight. I also wrote a [WIP textbook](https://calnotes.gitbook.io/cs61a-guidebook/) for the class, which is used sometimes. I started a student-run course on teaching students [full-stack web dev](https://fullstackdecal.com). It's been my long-standing dream to start a 3B1B-like series for CS. Perhaps now that I'm free from the shackles of homework, I'll get around to doing that.

## ⛏️ ~~Cosplaying~~ Entrepreneurship
In freshman year, I started a doomed startup with my friends. It was called VATT, with the mission to make audio-visual content on the internet language agnostic through automatic dubbing and subtitling. We sold it for half a grand in the end. It wasn't really a company. But it was a wonderful experience.

I spent a lot of time in college helping campus startups. This was through the Berkeley [Gateway to Innovation](https://begin.berkeley.edu) program, the [Student Entrepreneurship](https://step.berkeley.edu) program, [Cal Hacks Fellowship](https://fellowship.calhacks.io) and the [DRF Female Founders Track](https://femalefounders.dormroomfund.com/). Most startups are doomed, and that was the case with most startups I worked with, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't exist. Most of the process of starting something is just trying many, many times.

## 🐉 TTRPGs
I. Love. Dungeons and Dragons!! Yes, yes, I know — an appropriately nerdy hobby. I ran a campaign for a couple years through college. Through D&D, I learned about game theory and interaction design, improv and comedy, a tiny bit of 3D modelling and a whole lot about patience. *Email me and I'll run a game for you. Deadass.*

## 🎶 Music
I play the guitar sometimes. I'm shy about playing and I'm not very good and I'm not motivated enough to get better. But I like playing for myself. I love broadway music, pop, and the occassional indie rock. I made some embarrassing [visualizations](https://wave.amks.me) of my music tastes.
