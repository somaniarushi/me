## I build things that help other people build what they love.

Welcome to my little nook of the internet. A little bit about me:

- 📓 Studied Computer Science at [UC Berkeley]()
- 🤖 Building the future of automation as a Research Engineer @ [Adept AI Labs](https://adept.ai)
- 🤝 Making ML research more accessible through [the Daily Ink](/blog/tdi)
- ✍️ [Reading](https://goodreads.com/amks) and [writing](/blog)
- 🏋️ Lifting and getting [swole](https://fit.amks.me)

In a past life, I did a bunch of [other things](/about). Drop me a line at `hi@amks.me` if you ever want to chat, or grab some time off my calendar [here](https://calendly.com/asomani).
